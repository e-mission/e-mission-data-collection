# Phase 1: Build a model for User Utility Function (per Vij, Shankari)
# First, for each trip, we must obtain alternatives through some method
# (currently Google Maps API), alongside the actual trips which were taken.
# Once we have these alternatives, we can extract the features from each of the
# possible trips. Now, we utilize logistic regression with either the simple
# model given by Vij and Shankari, or utilizing their more complicated method.
# At the end, we want user-specific weights for their trip utility function.

# Phase 2: Choose optimal future trips
# Once we have determined a utility function for the user, we can evaluate
# future trips through this metric. This should look similar to our Phase 1,
# where we can obtain a set of alternative routes, and then choose an optimal
# trip based on the user's utility function. However, the key difference is that
# these trips are no longer static--in Phase 1, we can augment each trip with a
# set of alternative routes. In Phase 2, this learning is time-dependent (think traffic).
